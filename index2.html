			<h2>Small multiples</h2>

			<p>
				My task was to write a code, that would produce different pictures,
				depending on randomly chosen by computer data. I couldn't rely entirely
				on the random selection of values, because then the code simply wouldn't
				make sense at all, producing every time completely different results
				without any correlation with each other. I needed to limit the
				randomeness of my code, so to say.

				Speaking about randomness in general, its beauty lies in its ability to
				bring suddenness, innovation and a sense of freedom. It adds an element
				of unpredictability to our life. In simple words, randomness is like a
				box of surprises, making everything different and exciting. It adds a
				bit of magic to our world and helps create amazing things we might not
				have imagined otherwise. Even the slightest turn can lead to big
				changes. That is what I was thinking about, observing the differences in
				the output of my code.

				I don't think that it would be particularly advisable to explain in
				detail, how I wrote this code. However, for those interested, I will
				attach it below though.

function setup() {
// setup runs once
const canvas = createCanvas(520, 520);
canvas.parent("sketch");
background(255);
angleMode(DEGREES);

const step = 40;
const cell = step/2;

for (let x = cell / 2; x < width; x = x + step) {
	for (let y = cell / 2; y < height; y += step) {

		push();

		strokeWeight(random(1, 3));
		circle(x, y, cell + random(-30, 0));

		fill(10 + random(50, 200));
		let i = random(-10, 10);
		arc(x, y, cell + i, cell + i, random(0, 270), random(90, 360));

		noFill();
		let n = random(5, 10);
		arc(x, y, cell + n, cell + n, random(0, 270), random(90, 360));

		pop();
	}}}

function draw() {
	// draw runs all the time
}
function keyPressed() {
	if (key === "S" || key === "s") {
		save("smallmultiples-mkukharenka.png");
	}}
