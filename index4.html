			<h2>Sleeping uncle</h2>

			<p>
				With our final group project we summed up what we have learned during
				the semester. After some discussion we came to the conclusion that we
				are making a small indi game in real life. The plot of the game is as
				follows: the player needs to get to the kitchen to make themselves a
				sandwich, without waking up their angry sleeping monster uncle. If
				player wakes up the uncle, they lose.
			</p>

			<p>
				We divided into groups to distribute the work. Some of us were
				responsible for the design, some were involved in hadrware and physical
				building. I was in the frontend team.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although the following code was not used for the final version of the
				game, I'd still love to devote some time of my documentation to it. In
				this project I used sound as an input. When received by the device sound
				exceeded a certain value, the picture on the screen was replaced by a
				jumpscare.

				However, for the project we decided to use physical interaction as an
				input. That means that we created a button based mechanism that is
				triggered when pressed. In this way, we could combine the work of those
				who were responsible for displaying the picture on the screen and those
				who made possible phisical interaction with the player.
			</p>

			<p>
				The initial stages of work took place within my team. We learned how to
				add video to the code, launch it by pressing a certain key, chose sounds
				for different phases of the game.
			</p>

				After all the efforts, work on our project has finally come to an end.
				We managed to put all the teamwork together and made the game work as
				planned. The only thing left is to wait for our presentation ;)

			<p>
				While working on our project, I understood the importance of teamwork,
				especially for programming. When a team works together, tasks can be
				divided based on each member's strengths. This helps in completing the
				project more quickly and efficiently.
			</p>

			<p>
				Programming can be challenging, and having a team provides emotional
				support and motivation. Team members can encourage each other during
				tough times and celebrate successes together.
