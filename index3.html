			<h2>Little creatures</h2>

			<p>
				I find the following assignment especially important for practical
				application: I learned how to synchronize my code to work with other
				people's codes. It remimded me on playing in a music band, when each
				member has its own important role.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, music will never sound coherent, if one of the instruments is
				played in a different rythm with another. The same thing happens with
				code synchronization.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm not going to lie, I faced some difficulties on my way. But at the
				end I understood the importance of what I learned to do. This skill is a
				valuable aspect of collaborative software development. The ability to
				synchronize or integrate my code with others is very important for
				creating complex projects that involve multiple developers.

				Diverting from the general idea, I would like to draw attention to the
				creation of interaction between objects on the screen and mouse
				movement. I think this adds an important element of interactivity and
				contact with the viewer. With such a simple detail in the code you can
				diversify a simple boring picture and make it work way more amusing.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to that, I'm attaching below the code of my particle for
				those interested.
			</p>

			<pre><code>
class DonoParticle extends Particle {

	constructor(pos) {
		super(pos);
		this.color = color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
	}
				  
	setColor() {
		this.color = color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
	}
				  
	display() {
		fill(this.color);
		noStroke();
		rect(this.pos.x, this.pos.y, 50, 50);
		const distance = dist(mouseX, mouseY, this.pos.x, this.pos.y);
					
	if (distance < 200) {
		const angle = atan2(mouseY - this.pos.y, mouseX - this.pos.x);
		const newX = this.pos.x + cos(angle) * 10;
		const newY = this.pos.y + sin(angle) * 10;
		this.pos.x = newX;
		this.pos.y = newY;
		this.setColor();
	}}}
